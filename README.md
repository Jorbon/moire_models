# moire_models
A modeling / visual simulation utility for characterizing the potential effects of twist angles between layers of 2D materials on material properties.

This is software written for the Ovchinnikov Lab of the KU Department of Physics, primarily to help mathematically characterize the emergent Moire lattices in twisted systems. Palladium diselenide (PdSe2) and chromium oxygen chloride (CrOCl) layered with various hexagonal transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) such as molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) and tungsten disulfide (WS2) are particular subjects of interest. Our lab is quickly growing and we plan to fabricate, measure, and test devices containing such twisted systems in early 2024.

I have taken the first steps for a future paper on twisted PdSe2 systems using this software, and will do so for other materials as I develop the functionality of the app.
